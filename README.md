# Lacamas Project

The goal of this project is to remake the current LacamasFair.org website into a more modern and mobile friendly website. The fair itself takes place the weekend before labor day


## Goals
- Intuitive and mobile friendly navigation
- The FairBook and Entry Requirements are important but hard for users to discover and work with
- FairBook should be printable
- Electronic Forms should be available (save data to the database)
- Updateable gallery with fair images
- Create dynamic advertising partner spaces on the website
- Facility Rental Calendar
- Website should be light weight for users since internet/data speeds aren't always great near the fair

## Hosting
Web traffic is currently unknown by the client but they have 300 - 400 exhibitors for the fair, plus website visitors
